That project is an attempt to modularise Boost, thanks to both CMake and
Ruby/Rake. The project is hosted on GitHub: http://github.com/pocb/modboost.

There is (at least) another Boost modularisation initiative
(https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/wiki/CMakeModularizationStatus),
relying on three GitHub-hosted projects:
- http://github.com/ryppl/boost-modularize
- http://github.com/boost-lib/boost
- http://github.com/ryppl/boost-svn

ModBoost relies on all the good ideas from that project and tries to achieve
the same goals in a much simpler way. That can be achieved by using all
the expressivity and efficiency of Rake/Ruby, rather than CMake,
in order to handle the co-location of several modules (Boost libraries).
